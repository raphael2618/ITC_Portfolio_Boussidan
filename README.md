## Introduction

The project was developed with 3 programming languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I also used Bootstrap because I have a little-bit skill in it.

The project content 3 pages: 

1. **Index** : with a photo of me, 3 buttons: LinkedIn, Stack-overflow and GitHub that redirect to my account page and a footer with a list of the 3 pages and a sentence.

2. **About** : content some information about me: what are my degrees, where I live and why I decided to join ITC. It also content the same footer as the Index page. 

3. **Contact** : It contents a form with 5 fields: 
- First name, 
- Last name, 
- Email, 
- Comment, 
- Country,

 And a Submit button.

### JavaScript functionality

2. **About** : Change the maps contents according to previous / next buttons

3. **Contact** : Display all fields content of the form 
   
    Make the button submit disabled while one of the required fields is empty.
    
    Finally, the footer displays all the language that has been used in this project, according to an array.
